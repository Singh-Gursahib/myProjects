I wanted to share my first Flutter application: Tic-Tac-Toe!!

Created in 2021, this game has a welcome screen, scoreboard, and fun-to-use UI. Coded with the Flutter framework in Dart. I highly recommend the Flutter framework for its ease of use and production workflow. It's a great place to begin the journey of cross-platform application development. ðŸ˜‡
